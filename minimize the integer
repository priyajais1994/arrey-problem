// a person got a very large integer as his christmas present from his parents. he does not like large integer

//but changing too many digits will make person sad . he will change at most k digit of the given integer.
// person will perform the k changes in such a way that the final integer does not contain leading zeros.
// print the minimum integer that person can get.
